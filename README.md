# üõçÔ∏è Fullstack Product List (React + Express + Axios)

This project is a simple full-stack application demonstrating how to connect a **React frontend** (built with **Vite**) to a **Node.js/Express backend** API. It uses the **Axios** library to fetch data from the server and display it in a user-friendly, centered layout.

## üåü Final Result

This is what the application looks like when running:
